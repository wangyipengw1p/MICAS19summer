# Projects @ Prof. Marian Verhelst's group, MICAS, KU LEUVEN, 2019 summer
This repository only contains my work and does not contains other results or ideas of Prof. Marian's group. My research topic is to implement two methods for image mosaicing.

## Demo construction for SpyNet
This folder contains a RTL design (in Verilog) of the core. ZYNQ block designed is not uploaded. But refer to [here](https://github.com/wangyipengw1p/zynq/tree/master/dual_cam_display) as an example design.

## RTL design for Sphere sweeping
Sphere sweeping algorithm is proposed by Ominivision. Here's a dedicated hardware design in VHDL.
